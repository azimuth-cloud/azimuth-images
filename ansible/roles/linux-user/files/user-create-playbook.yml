          Note that this user storage (/home/azimuth) is ephemeral, but is persistent through
          platform patches. All system level changes outside of the home directory will be lost
          on a platform patch.

          When configured by the Azimuth operator and supported by the platform, an additional
          filesystem is mounted at /project. This filesystem persists after the platform is deleted
          and is shared with other platforms in the tenancy.
